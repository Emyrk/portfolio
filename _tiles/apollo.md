# Apollo Codes

## Abstract

Hackathon submission to BrickHack V, claiming the "Most Commercially Viable Product" prize. Apollo Codes is a code education tool to display the live coding alongside a tutorial video. 

When watching code tutorials, it is often difficult to follow the actual code. This tool has the full code alongside the video, allowing for copying/navigating/etc. The live updating feature ensures the code always matches the video, and ability to navigate allows a user to refer to other code segments without having to rewind the video.

Please refer to the devpost or demo link to see the project.

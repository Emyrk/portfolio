# Cryptid

## Abstract

Cryptid was created as an entry to the Borderless Block Party -- Bitcoin and Blockchain Hackathon. This hackathon was 30 days online, and Cryptid took 2nd place.

Cryptid is a decentralized identification verification system. The buzzwords just mean that it is a physical ID that be proven to be authentic by any person or party through the blockchain. The public verification makes Cryptid unique, as most centralized identification systems (such as government ones) can only be verified by those who have access to the private databases.

# Why it was created

The idea behind Cryptid was to make an security and econonmically superior identification system to that of schools and even goverment issued IDs. Cryptid utilizes a 3 factor authentication scheme: "something you have", "something you know", "something you are" (biometrics). The minimal cost associated behind the issuance and creation of the ID actually makes it a cheaper solution to maintaining a private database. It's public nature also means reusability of a single ID for multiple applications; club memberships, school student status, etc.

# Project Details

The devpost contains a video demo of the project. My team and I actually manufactured the IDs and obtained fingerprint readers to develop a full proof of concept.
